# HuffMan Coding

File Reading: Firstly, I have called the ReadMe() function in which I read the data from text file “character by character” and stored them in a string and return that string to main function. In this step, I also checked Validity of Characters. 

Validation of ASCII Values: I have included the validation checks while reading the file. If there is some character read by file that is not ASCII value, it will display ERROR message and end the program.

Finding Frequencies: Then I found the frequencies of each character in the string and created two more character arrays i.e., one for number of distinct characters and other for their frequencies.

IMPRESSIVE Menu: I have created an impressive Menu for User in which he/she select whether he/she want to implement Huffman Tree or Optimized Huffman Tree.

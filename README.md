# Huffman Coding Project for Parsing file using Huffman Tree

## Overview
This project focuses on designing and implementing a Huffman Coding system for efficient data compression and decompression. Utilizing advanced algorithms and data structures, this system optimizes file storage by effectively parsing files and representing them in compressed formats.

## Features

### File Reading
- **ReadMe Function**: Reads data from a text file "character by character," storing them in a string that is returned to the main function. This step includes the validation of characters to ensure they are valid ASCII values.
- **Error Handling**: Implements validation checks while reading the file. If a non-ASCII character is detected, the program displays an ERROR message and terminates.

### Frequency Finder
- **Character Frequency Calculation**: Calculates the frequency of each character in the string and stores this data in two arraysâ€”one for the distinct characters and another for their corresponding frequencies.

### User Interface
- **Interactive Menu**: Provides an impressive user menu allowing the choice between standard Huffman Tree and Optimized Huffman Tree implementations.

## Tech Stack
- **C++**: Utilized for the core programming.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Facilitates better data management and more modular code.
- **Data Structures**: Employs advanced data structures for efficient data handling and manipulation.
- **Tree Structures**: Uses trees for the logical representation of Huffman coding.
